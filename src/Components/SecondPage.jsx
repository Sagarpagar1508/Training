                        <p>Fund accounting is a specialized accounting system used primarily by non-profit organizations, government entities, and other institutions where accountability rather than profitability is the primary focus. Unlike traditional for-profit accounting, which tracks the overall financial performance of a business, fund accounting segregates resources into various funds or accounts to ensure that they are used for their intended purposes. Each fund operates as a separate entity with its own set of financial statements, enabling organizations to track the allocation, use, and balance of financial resources. </p>
